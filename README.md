# UoB_BC_Horiseon_Code_Refactor

# Introduction
For this piece of work i had to refactor the code provided from a fictional online marketing company named Horiseon. The objectives were simple: check the HTML (and alter it where necessary) to ensure basic accessibility standards were met, and consolidate the CSS to make it easier to read/navigate.

## Why did I do this?
To ensure i better understood why accessibility standards are so important to the modern web. Additionally, it was to solidify the knowledge i had accumulated up until the point this piece of work was finished.

### What I learnt
Throughout this particular piece of work i learnt a great deal about concepts such as: accessibility and the standards associate with them set out by W3C, semantic HTML elements, the importance of the readability of HTML & CSS documents, why it's important to consolidate CSS where applicable, and how GitHub pages work.

#### For the future
If i were to alter any portion of this piece of work in the future it would be the CSS file, to make the site responsive to a much wider variety of viewport sizes.
